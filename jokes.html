		<h1> Funny Jokes </h1>
    <p class="quote"> A child is playing ROBLOX when someone says "IDGAF". She asks her dad what it means.</p>
<p>Girl: What does IDGAF mean?
<br>Dad: I don't give a f***.
<br>The girl, unaware that that is the correct answer, storms off to her mother.
<br>Girl: What does IDGAF mean?
<br>Mom: I don't give a f***.
<br>She gives up.
<br>The next day, the girl and her parents are out walking when a teen says LOL. The adults are not familiar with these kind of acronyms, so they ask thier daughter.
<br>Parents: What does LOL mean?

		<h1> Bragging about sons joke </h1>
        <p>Three old ladies are sitting around a table playing bridge and bragging about their sons.<br> 
        “My Freddie,” said Margaret, “Everyone should be so lucky to have a son like my Freddie. Once a week he brings me a huge bouquet of flowers, he’s constantly bringing me out to restaurants to eat, if I so much as hint that I want something the next morning it’s on my doorstep.” 
        <br>“That’s very nice about your Freddie”, says Gertrude. 
        <br>“But with all due respect, when I think about the way my Sammy takes care of me, it just can’t compare. Every morning as soon as I wake up he greets me with bacon and freshly brewed coffee. Every lunch he comes over and cooks me a gourmet lunch, and every supper he brings me to his house for supper, he truly treats me like a queen.” 
        <br>“WELL!” Says Barbara “I don’t want to make any of you feel bad or anything, but wait until you hear about my Harry, twice a week he pays someone $200 an hour just so he can lie on their couch and talk to them, and who do you think he speaks about at those prices? Asks Barbara with a big excited double chin smile, “I’ll tell you who he speaks about! ALL HE SPEAKS ABOUT IS ME!” </p>
